Email from Alberto:

So this is the first data management need for the analysis of TB mortality! I am so excited!! I think i could download the database i wanted, so pretty cool!

I think i could potentially do it, but I am pretty sure you can do it much much faster!

I would need this dataset to be reorganized in a "easy to analyze" format.

I basically would like each country in each row and the other variables as columns. 

As you can see, there are columns which are tags to different codes... I still don't know how i want that, since i will probably work in stata... So i will try to organize the labels myself (unless there is a universal way of doing it"

I am engaging with WHO to get the exact same data from their estimates... From the files that are publically available it is not supereasy, because they are not in database format
