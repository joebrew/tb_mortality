Alberto,

ADJUSTMENT TO -100/100:
You're right that this was not correct. Indeed, with the new metric (Martien's), the negative extreme was greater than the positive extreme. I've now adjusted this so that the re-scaling is incorrect.

NO MORE LIMITS TO CHARTS:
I've removed the limits (both y and x) to the charts, as per your suggestion.

95% CI:
You asked me to adjust the following text: "Scatter plots of the adjusted standardized difference between IHME and WHO mortality estimates and various potential drivers of this difference showed no association with reported HIV prevalence
among TB cases (r= 0.001, 95%CI: -0.14-0.14) , multidrug/rifampicin resistance prevalence (r= -0.01, 95%CI: -0.19-0.09) and case fatality rate (r= -0.18, 95%CI: -0.31-0.04). There was a moderate
association with case detection rate (as estimated by WHO), (r= -0.36, 95%CI: -0.48 - -0.24), which experiences an inverse association when using CDR based on IHME number of incident cases (r=
0.43, 95%CI: 0.31-0.53) ( ​ figure 4 ​ )"

Can you actually send me the text instead? I don't want to be commenting / adusting text out of context, and which pertains to a figure I cannot see.
